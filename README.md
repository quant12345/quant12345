### Hi, I'm Kamil 👋

I started programming in MQL4,5 (Metatrader) since 2013, over time, mastering other stacks for myself.

Stack:

Python (pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, PyQt5, Django), PostgreSQL, MQL4,5(Metatrader).

WEB(HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

My profile Stackoverflow

Noisy neighbors have been living above me for 10 years now.
They make noise on purpose. I have achieved some success in programming (considering the conditions in which 
I live, this is more than a good result). And I need a job to leave. I turn to the community if anyone can help.
